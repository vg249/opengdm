      x-tag-description: "The platform describes the general chemistry used to generate\
        \ marker genotyping data. Examples of platforms are KASP, Illumina, etc. All\
        \ markers must be associated with a platform.\nThere are several considerations\
        \ for defining platforms.\n1. Consistency of data generated: the expectation\
        \ is that within each platform, the genotyping data generated by a marker\
        \ name should give consistent results to allow for future composite scores\
        \ by marker. A marker that generates data using different chemistry or separation\
        \ methods would likely give different results and should be placed in separate\
        \ platforms (or given a different marker name).\n2. Avoiding unnecessary duplication\
        \ of marker names:  if five different sequencing methods each produce the\
        \ same or overlapping marker names that give equivalent genotyping scores,\
        \ they should all be placed under a single platform. For example, \"Sequencing,\"\
        \ and the five methods described using protocols. \n3. Extract requirements:\
        \ one of the primary extracts will be by   platform, and so consider how the\
        \ user will want to extract data."
