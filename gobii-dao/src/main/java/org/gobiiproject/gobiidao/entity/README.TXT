The files in this org.gobiiproject.gobiidao.entity package were
used to proof-of-concept the use of Hibernate. In the end, we were
unable to easily get Hibernate to work with PostGRESQL's more modern
data types, especially JSONB. So the real work is being done in the
org.gobiiproject.gobiidao.resultset package.
